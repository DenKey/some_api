## Task

At Decathlon, we sell products in different sizes (S-M-L) and colors (Blue - Green - White) 
for multiple in-house sport's brands (one brand per sport: Kipsta for football, 
Quechua for hiking, Artengo for tennis, etc). Every products are available for a certain 
duration, some for a season and some for several years. The availability period can be discontinued.
Based on this context, we would like you to write a Backend API with CRUD endpoints.
